# Networking Options
####################
# This should be a VIP, an unused IP on your network that will float between
# the hosts running keepalived for high availability.
kolla_internal_vip_address: "$vip_address"

# This interface is what all your API services will be bound to by default.
# This interface must contain an IPv4 address.
network_interface: "eth0"

# This is the raw interface given to Neutron as its external network port. Even
# though an IP address can exist on this interface, it will be unusable in most
# configurations. For this reason, it is recommended to not assign any IP addresses
# to this interface. Don't specify the same interface as network_interface!
neutron_external_interface: "eth3"

# The interface used by your Virtuozzo Storage cluster. By default this is the same
# interface as network_interface although this is not recommended.
# This interface must contain an IPv4 address.
storage_interface: "eth2"

# This interface will be used for virtual overlay networks. By default this is the same
# interface as network_interface although this is not recommended.
# This interface must contain an IPv4 address.
tuninel_interface: "eth1"

# Arbitrary number from 0..255 used for VRRP.
# Must be unique within the current broadcast domain.

# Neutron options
#################

# 192.168.128.0/24 by default.
#neutron_private_net_cidr: "192.168.128.0/24"

# IP pool for the private network. If this option is not specified,
# Neutron allocates IP addresses within the entire private CIDR.
# Format: "start1-end1,start2-end2". Example: "192.168.128.100-192.168.128.200".

# Comma-separated list of DNS addresses served to instances using
# DHCP when connected to the private network.
#neutron_private_net_dns: "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4"

# Public network CIDR. Required option.
# Value must reflect the physical network attached to neutron_external_interface.
# Example: "172.16.50.0/24".
#neutron_public_net_cidr: ""

# Floating IP pool for the public network. If this option is not specified,
# Neutron allocates IP addresses within the entire public CIDR.
# Format: "start1-end1,start2-end2". Example: "172.16.50.100-172.16.50.200".
#neutron_public_net_pool: ""

# Default gateway address in the public network. If not specified, Neutron
# uses the first address in the public network CIDR.
# Example: "172.16.50.1".
